Today was fantastic. I could start to visualize how a webpage could be created out of "legoBlocks"
Components are a neat way of organizing the code by sections of the page, and also by functionality.

The App.js file is like that master file, with a blueprint layout and a bunch of names.
The other files in the directory called modules, is where the backstage fun happens. 
Think of it like theatre, you have your "set design crew" and "your lighting crew" and your "sound crew" and your "stage hands crew"
Inside of each module, is a detailed procedure describing how that team will excute it's job. We call this "functions"

The teams come together on the App.js page and work together to preform a masterpiece called the webpage! They know where to gp, based on where they are located on the App.js file.
